Perfect, Godfrey. Since you‚Äôve already written this amazing automation logic in plain text using VS Code, here‚Äôs how to **migrate and implement it step-by-step into Power Automate Desktop (PAD)** so it becomes a GUI-driven, maintainable flow with full error handling, loops, and file interaction.

---

## ‚úÖ STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE: From VS Code Script to Power Automate Desktop

### üéØ GOAL:

Replicate your automation script inside **Microsoft Power Automate Desktop**, so you can:

* Run it graphically or as a background task
* Easily manage logic without rewriting every line
* Use native GUI-based drag-and-drop actions
* Export/share/update flows in PAD

---

## üîπ STEP 1: Open Power Automate Desktop

1. Launch **Power Automate Desktop**.
2. Click **+ New Flow**.
3. Name it `MT5 Backtest Automation` (or similar).

---

## üîπ STEP 2: Declare All Your Variables

From your script, you have these variables:

* `mt5Path`, `eaPath`, `reportPath`
* `startDate`, `endDate`
* `reportCounter`, `maxRetries`, `initialLoadTime`, etc.

### üëâ To declare in PAD:

1. Go to **Variables** tab on the right.
2. Click **‚Äú+ Add Input/Flow Variable‚Äù**.
3. Add each variable and give it a **default value**.

   * Example:

     * Name: `mt5Path`
     * Type: `Text`
     * Default: `C:\Program Files\MetaTrader 5 EXNESS\terminal64.exe`

Repeat for:

* `eaPath`
* `reportPath`
* `logFilePath`
* `timeframes` (as list)
* `currencies` (as list)

---

## üîπ STEP 3: Set Up Initialization Logic

Use PAD actions to recreate the setup section:

* **Check folder exists**: use `If Folder Exists` ‚Üí `Create Folder` if not.
* **Append log text**: use `Write text to file` or `Append line to text file`.

### PAD Actions You‚Äôll Use:

| Function        | PAD Action                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Create folders  | `Create new folder`                   |
| Check existence | `If folder exists` / `If file exists` |
| Logging         | `Append line to text file`            |
| Time/Date       | `Get current date and time`           |

---

## üîπ STEP 4: Implement Configuration File Loader (Optional)

You load config from a `.txt` file like `backtest_config.txt`.

To mimic this:

1. Use `Read text from file`.
2. Use `Split text` on newline (`\r\n`).
3. Use `For Each` loop over lines.
4. Use `Split text` on `=` to separate keys/values.
5. Use `Set Variable` to update values dynamically.

You can even **make a subflow called `Load Configuration`**.

---

## üîπ STEP 5: Define Core Loops

From your code:

```plaintext
FOR EACH ea IN eaList:
    FOR EACH currency IN currencies:
        FOR EACH timeframe IN timeframes:
```

### In PAD:

1. Use `Get files in folder` to list `.ex5` files ‚Üí store in `eaList`.
2. Use `For Each`:

   * Over `eaList`
   * Inside it, `For Each` over `currencies` list
   * Inside that, `For Each` over `timeframes` list

Inside the innermost loop, you will insert:

* Logic to launch MT5
* Simulate key presses using `Send Keys`
* Export XML
* Save logs
* Error handling via `Begin Error Handling` block

---

## üîπ STEP 6: Control MT5 with GUI Actions

You‚Äôll use:

* `Send Keys` to interact with MT5 and Strategy Tester
* `Wait` for delays (or `Wait for window`)
* `Condition` to check if `Strategy Tester` window exists

Add backup send keys for:

* Opening Strategy Tester (`Alt+T`, `Ctrl+R`)
* Selecting EA name
* Selecting currency pair
* Setting timeframe
* Launching the test (`F9`)
* Exporting report (`Ctrl+S`, typing name, saving)

---

## üîπ STEP 7: Export XML Report

Use:

1. `Send Keys` to open ‚ÄúSave as‚Äù dialog.
2. Use `Send Keys` for filename (customize like `EA_Currency_Timeframe.xml`)
3. Use `Send Keys` ‚Üí Enter to save.

---

## üîπ STEP 8: Error Handling & Logging

PAD gives you:

* `Begin Error Handling` / `End Error Handling`
* Inside the error handler, log to file, take a screenshot (`Capture window`), or restart MT5.

You already did this in text. Replicate it with:

* `Append line to text file`
* `Take screenshot`
* `Terminate process` (for MT5)
* `Run application` to relaunch

---

## üîπ STEP 9: Resume Using Checkpoint File (Advanced)

Store JSON checkpoint in a file:

* Use `Write text to file` to save checkpoint (EA, currency, TF index).
* On start, `Read file` and parse it ‚Üí use to `Continue` from previous position.

You can even parse JSON in PAD using `Parse JSON` (if using newer versions) or simple text parsing.

---

## üîπ STEP 10: Save and Test

* Save the flow.
* Click **Run** to test with a single EA/currency/timeframe.
* Once verified, scale up the loops and let it run fully.

---

### üõ† Bonus Tip:

To make it launch your `.pad` flow on reboot:

* Use **Task Scheduler** with the command:

  ```cmd
  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Power Automate Desktop\PAD.Console.Host.exe" run --name "MT5 Backtest Automation"
  ```

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Task           | How to do it in PAD                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Variables      | Set them in Variables tab                      |
| Folder checks  | Use `If folder exists` + `Create folder`       |
| Logging        | Use `Append line to text file`                 |
| System control | `Run application`, `Terminate process`, `Wait` |
| GUI automation | `Send keys`, `Wait for window`, `Focus window` |
| Error handling | `Begin error handling` block                   |
| Report saving  | Send keys to export as `.xml`                  |
| Checkpointing  | Write JSON to a text file                      |

Would you like me to generate a **starter Power Automate Desktop `.pad` flow file** based on this logic for you to import?
